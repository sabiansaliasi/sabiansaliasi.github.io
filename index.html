            <p>      I am an undergraduate student in the department of mathematics at the University of Miami. My research interests are in low-dimensional topology, where I am especially interested in gauge theory and Floer homology.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I am not working on mathematics, then I can likely be found out-and-about, somewhere in the local neighbhorhood, running.

      I am an Undergraduate student in the Department of Mathematics at University of Miami. My curiosity is especially piqued by low-dimensional topology, namely when studied through gauge and Floer theoretic methods, or thorugh geometric topological methods.
