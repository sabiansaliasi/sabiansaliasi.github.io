            <p>      I am an undergraduate student in the department of mathematics at the University of Miami. My research interests reside in low-dimensional topology, where I am especially interested in gauge theory and floer homology.

            <p>
              If you need me, and I am not nearby doing math, then please come find me out-and-about, somewhere in your neighbhorhood, running.

      I am an Undergraduate student in the Department of Mathematics at University of Miami. My curiosity is especially piqued by low-dimensional topology, namely when studied through gauge and Floer theoretic methods, or thorugh geometric topological methods.
